# Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for Uyo. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the Q-Affinity Quantum Club at Uyo, please consider joining our club. We meet every second Saturda of the month at an announced location.

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here on Uyo is going to be a hackathon, starting on October 22nd. Details about the hackathon and rules can be found below. The deadline for all projects is October 29th, at 4pm WAT. Any projects submitted after that will NOT be judged. Good luck!

# Hackathon Details

All projects submitted must follow the hackathon prompt, which we will reveal at the Opening Ceremony on Oct. 22nd at 4pm
All projects must use Qiskit, the open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and application modules. You can learn more about Qiskit and begin getting familiar here.
You can not start building your project before the Opening Ceremony, and you must submit your project by the deadline.
